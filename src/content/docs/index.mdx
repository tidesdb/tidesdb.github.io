	<Card title="Log Structured" icon="document">
		TidesDB is built on the idea of a log structured merge tree.  It is a storage engine in nature written entirely in C.  It is accessed as a library.  Keys and values are simply raw sequences of bytes with no predetermined size restrictions.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Optimized for modern hardware" icon="seti:plan">
		TidesDB is designed to work efficiently with modern storage solutions like flash drives and SSDs. It takes advantage of the improved read/write capabilities of these technologies to provide good performance in low-latency environments.

<Card title="Basic to Advanced Storage Operations" icon="seti:favicon">
		TidesDB is a comprehensive storage engine featuring ACID-compliant transactions, concurrent multi-threaded access, and atomic operations to ensure data integrity. It supports bidirectional cursors, write-ahead logging, and optimizations through multithreaded compaction and bloom filters.

		The system offers multiple compression options (Snappy, LZ4, ZSTD), time-to-live settings, and block indices for faster reads. With an intuitive API, user-friendly error handling, and cross-platform support for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, TidesDB combines powerful functionality with ease of use. It also supports advanced range and filter queries and provides column-family statistics via its public API.
